Hello, Mr Phillips. Take a seat. Thank you. Now, what seems to be the problem? I'm not feeling very well. I've got a terrible stomach ache and I keep throwing up. Have you had any diarrhoea? No, I haven't. How long have you been feeling like this? It's late last night. Do you know if you're allergic to anything? No, not that I know of. What have you eaten recently? Well, my two children cooked dinner for my wife and me last night. It was our wedding anniversary, you see, and they wanted to surprise us. That was a nice thought. What did you have? Well, I'm not sure what it was, actually. Some sort of a seafood and pasta dish. They spent a long time cooking it, so, you know, I felt I had to eat it.
It wasn't very nice to be honest. My wife hardly ate any, so I ate hers too. OK, I think you've got food poisoning. The best thing to do is to rest and don't eat anything for the next 24 hours. After that you can eat things like bread or rice, but no milk or cheese. Right. And drink lots of water. Or black tea with a little sugar in. OK. Do I need to make another appointment? No, I'm sure you'll be fine. But come back if you're not feeling better in two days. Thanks a lot. And maybe tell your children that you want to go to a restaurant next year? Yes, I will. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hello, Mr Green. Please sit down. Thanks. What seems to be the problem? Well, I haven't been feeling very well recently. My chest hurts and I can't talk.
I keep getting really bad headaches. Have you been taking anything for them? Yes, paracetamol, but it didn't really help much. Have you got any other symptoms? Yes. I can't stop sneezing. Yes, I can see that. And how long have you been feeling like this? Oh, let me see. It's three days now. Right, let me have a look at you. Say ah. Ah. That's fine, thanks. I'm just going to take your temperature. Yes, you've got a bit of a temperature. But nothing serious. I think you've got a virus. You need to stay in bed and rest for two or three days. Do I need a... Bless you. Bless you.
Thanks. Do I need some antibiotics? I'm allergic to penicillin, by the way. No, antibiotics don't work with viruses. But I'm going to give you something stronger for the headaches. Oh, right. Here's a prescription for some painkillers. Thanks a lot. How often should I take them? Every four hours. If you're not better in three days, then come back and we'll do some blood tests. Thank you, Doctor. Not at all. Goodbye. Bye. Right, who's the next patient? Oh, no.
